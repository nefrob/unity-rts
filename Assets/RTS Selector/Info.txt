Thank you for using the RTS Selector Asset by Sun Dryd Studios

Here is a quick tutorial on how to use it!


1. Place the "Selecting Box" prefab onto a canvas object with the render mode set to "Overlay"

2. Place the "Highlight Ring" onto any of the objects you would like to be highlighted.

3. Profit!


You can change which array you reference and seperate them how ever you would like for your project! 

We did our best to comment the code for you to modify.
